A salty fish is now studying vue.js, so he wanna do sth to practice.
And because he is very very salty, he decide to write article in English(Chinglish).

One day, he is wondering, why not use vue.js to build a blog system?
Although there are lots of wheels implenenting the blog system, he still want to write one by himself. Why? Because very salty, of course.
